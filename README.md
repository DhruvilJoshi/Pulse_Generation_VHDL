# Pulse_Generation_VHDL

It is a Finite State Machine. A finite-state machine or finite-state automaton, finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. This Finite State Machine generates a simple Pulse generation in waveform.
